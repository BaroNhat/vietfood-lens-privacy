        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <h3>Google Maps API</h3>
        <p>We use Google Maps API services in our App to provide you with location-based features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nearby Search:</strong> We use your location data to search for restaurants and food establishments near you using Google's Places API.</li>
            <li><strong>Place Details:</strong> We retrieve detailed information about specific locations including address, opening hours, reviews, and photos from Google Places API.</li>
            <li><strong>Directions:</strong> We use Google Directions API to provide navigation routes to restaurants.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you use these features, your location data and search queries are sent to Google. This information is subject to Google's Privacy Policy, which can be found at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

        <h3>Cloudinary</h3>
        <p>We use Cloudinary to store and manage the photos you upload to our App (both for your recognition history and, if you consent, for AI training). Cloudinary's use of your data is governed by their Privacy Policy, which can be found at <a href="https://cloudinary.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cloudinary.com/privacy</a>.</p>

        <h2>Recognition History and Training Data</h2>
        <h3>Recognition History</h3>
        <p>When you take a photo to identify a Vietnamese dish, the image is stored in your personal history so you can revisit previous recognitions. You may delete any photo from your history at any time, and it will be permanently removed from our system (including from Cloudinary).</p>

        <h3>AI Training Data (Optional)</h3>
        <p>With your <strong>explicit consent</strong>, photos you capture may also be stored in a separate dataset on Cloudinary to help us train and improve our food recognition model. These images may be associated with your user ID internally for management and auditing purposes, but they will not be shown publicly and are used exclusively for machine learning improvement. You may contact us to request removal of training data previously shared with consent.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can enable or disable this feature at any time directly on the home screen using the "Allow Save" toggle.</li>
            <li>Training images are not shown in your history.</li>
            <li>Deleting a photo from your history does not automatically remove it from the training dataset if previously shared with consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Permissions We Request</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To allow you to take photos of food for recognition.</li>

            <li><strong>Location:</strong> To provide location-based features such as finding nearby restaurants and restaurant recommendations (Permissions: <code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code>, <code>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</code>).</li>
