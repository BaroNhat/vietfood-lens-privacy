        <h1>Privacy Policy for VietFood Lens</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 25, 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to VietFood Lens ("we," "us," or "our"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("App").</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Information you provide when contacting us, including email communications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Third-Party Authentication</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Sign-In:</strong> When you choose to sign in with Google, we receive information from your Google account such as your name, email address, and profile picture. We only store and use this information to manage your account with us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect information about your mobile device, including device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information using the <code>device_info_plus</code> plugin.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> With your permission, we collect your precise location data to provide location-based features such as finding nearby restaurants and navigation services using the <code>geolocator</code> and <code>location</code> plugins.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you use our App, including features you use and time spent on the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Photos and Media:</strong> With your permission, we access your camera and photo library to allow you to take and upload photos of food.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Token:</strong> To enable us to send you push notifications, our App collects a unique registration token (FCM token) generated by Firebase for your specific app installation on your device. This token allows us to direct notifications to your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our App and its services.</li>
            <li>Provide and improve the accuracy of our Vietnamese food recognition feature.</li>
            <li>Manage your account and facilitate your use of the App's features.</li>
            <li>Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Send you push notifications:</strong> With your permission (which, on Android 13 and newer, includes the explicit `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission granted by you), we use your FCM token to send you push notifications regarding App updates, new features, important alerts, promotional messages (if you opt-in to receive them), or other information relevant to your use of our App. These notifications may utilize sound and vibration to alert you.</li>
            <li>Respond to your comments, questions, and provide customer service.</li>
            <li>Develop new products and services.</li>
            <li>Generate anonymized, aggregate statistics about how users interact with our App to understand usage patterns and improve our services.</li>
            <li>Protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other illegal activity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <h3>Google Services (including Google Maps API & Firebase)</h3>
        <p>We use Google services in our App:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Maps API:</strong> We use your location data to search for restaurants and food establishments near you using Google's Places API. We retrieve detailed information about specific locations including address, opening hours, reviews, and photos from Google Places API. We use Google Directions API to provide navigation routes to restaurants.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM):</strong> We use Firebase (a Google service) to deliver push notifications. The FCM registration token is shared with Firebase to facilitate the sending of these notifications to your device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you use these features, relevant data (location data, search queries, FCM token) is sent to Google. This information is subject to Google's Privacy Policy, which can be found at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

        <h3>Cloudinary</h3>
        <p>We use Cloudinary to store and manage the photos you upload to our App (both for your recognition history and, if you consent, for AI training). Cloudinary's use of your data is governed by their Privacy Policy, which can be found at <a href="https://cloudinary.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cloudinary.com/privacy</a>.</p>

        <h2>Recognition History and Training Data</h2>
        <h3>Recognition History</h3>
        <p>When you take a photo to identify a Vietnamese dish, the image is stored in your personal history so you can revisit previous recognitions. You may delete any photo from your history at any time, and it will be permanently removed from our system (including from Cloudinary).</p>

        <h3>AI Training Data (Optional)</h3>
        <p>With your <strong>explicit consent</strong>, photos you capture may also be stored in a separate dataset on Cloudinary to help us train and improve our food recognition model. These images may be associated with your user ID internally for management and auditing purposes, but they will not be shown publicly and are used exclusively for machine learning improvement. You may contact us to request removal of training data previously shared with consent.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can enable or disable this feature at any time directly on the home screen using the "Allow Save" toggle.</li>
            <li>Training images are not shown in your history.</li>
            <li>Deleting a photo from your history does not automatically remove it from the training dataset if previously shared with consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Permissions We Request</h2>
        <p>To provide our services, we may request the following permissions on your device. You can manage these permissions through your device settings.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To allow you to take photos of food for recognition.</li>
            <li><strong>Photo Library/Media Access:</strong> To allow you to upload existing photos from your device for recognition, and for the App to potentially save images if needed (Permissions: <code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code>, <code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> for older Android versions; <code>READ_MEDIA_IMAGES</code>, <code>READ_MEDIA_VIDEO</code> for Android 13+).</li>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> To provide location-based features such as finding nearby restaurants and restaurant recommendations (Permissions: <code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code>, <code>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Internet:</strong> To connect to our servers (including Cloudinary and Google Maps API) and provide our services (Permission: <code>INTERNET</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Push Notifications (<code>POST_NOTIFICATIONS</code>):</strong> To send you notifications about app updates, new features, and other relevant information. On Android 13 (API level 33) and higher, we will request this permission from you at runtime. On iOS, you will be prompted by the system to allow notifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Vibration (<code>VIBRATE</code>):</strong> To allow notifications to vibrate your device to alert you, enhancing the notification experience. This permission is generally granted by default if declared but works in conjunction with your device's notification and vibration settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We may share your information with:</p>
        <ul>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sharing Initiated by You:</strong> When you choose to share content from our App with friends or on social media platforms using your device's native sharing functionalities. In such cases, the sharing is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party platforms.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
                <ul>
